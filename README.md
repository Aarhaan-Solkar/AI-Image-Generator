This guide provides a detailed description of how to build such an application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Prerequisites
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
An OpenAI API key to access the DALL-E model.
A web server to host your application (optional for local development).

# Final Steps
Replace YOUR_API_KEY in script.js with your actual OpenAI API key.
Open index.html in a web browser to test your application.

# Conclusion
This guide provides a basic framework for creating an image generator using DALL-E with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can further enhance the application by adding features like loading indicators, error handling, and customization options for the generated images.
